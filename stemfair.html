<h3>Stem Fair is American Stem Prep.'s massive science fair that is held in once a year.</h3><br>
    <h3>Our group, 10th graders, decided to build a smart apartment complex.</h3><br>
    <h3>First of all, we divided parts to accomplish before the due date, Stem Fair day.</h3><br>
    <h3>I was responsible for designing the whole apartment complex including apartments, park, outdoor facillities, and department store.</h3><br>
    <h3>Also I built everything else, with various materials, that I designed, except the apartments. </h3><br>
    <h3>Everyone gave their amazing effort to the parts that were responsible for them.</h3><br>
    <h3>Overall, we communicated extraordinarily well and finished. </h3><br>
    <h3>I learned how to design the whole apartment complex.</h3><br>

    <h1>Ask</h1>
    <h3>How can we satisfy and attract the residents with an astonishing place?</h3><br>
    <h1>Imagine</h1>
    <h3>The idea of Smart Apartment Complex, inspired from the concept of Smart City.</h3><br>
    <h1>Plan</h1>
    <h3>Design, measure, and searched for the appropriate/stable materials for the whole Smart Apartment Complex. Also, divided the whole complex into three districts.</h3><br>
    <h1>Create</h1>
    <h3>- Slice foam boards accurately by the setted magnitude (size). e.g. (The top square piece for apartment was 20cmX20cm.)</h3><br>
    <h3>- Create 3D models with TinkerCad and print them through 3D printers. e.g. (Promotion wheel-less Lamborghini, basketball hoops, golf course, etc)</h3><br>
    <h3>- Deorate the complete pieces with various decorative materials.</h3><br>
    <h3>- Combine completed three districts and compare the size.</h3><br>
    <h1>Improve</h1>
    <h3>- Add gold ribbons on top of the apartments, because they looked empty.</h3><br>
    <h3>- Reprint or add more facilities on the park. e.g. (playground, benches, tables, stage, fountain, etc.)</h3><br>
